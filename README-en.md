## 📖 **About the Project**

**VolunteerCodeCarajas** is much more than a system. This is a **learning project with real impact**. Born in the heart of the **Associação Carajás de Pessoas com Deficiência**, in Tucuruí - PA, this system aims to transform the association's management through **technology, data, and inclusion**.
Every line of code written here is a step toward a more accessible, fair, and inclusive world. 🚀

This is a **volunteer project**, which I started developing **from scratch**, with the goal to **learn, grow, and impact lives**. My journey began on **04/10/2025**, and this is just the beginning. This repository, still empty of advanced functionalities, contains **the first step**: the **member registration system**. As I learn and grow, the system will be expanded to **manage dues, finances, and projects of the association**.

## 🧑‍💻 **About Me** - Roberta, the Volunteer Developer

Hello! 👋 I’m **Pamella Roberta Ferreira da Silva**, or **Roberta**, a student of **Computer Engineering** at **UFPA**, with a love for **Data**. My goal is to apply what I’ve studied in theory to create something with purpose and social impact. 🌱

I am **autistic** and have **ADHD**, which brings challenges but also a unique way of seeing the world. This condition, far from being a barrier, has become a driving force to break **barriers and ableism**. This project is not just an **academic learning** for me, but a way to **overcome my own limitations** and, at the same time, **help overcome barriers for others**. 💙

As a volunteer at the Associação Carajás de Pessoas com Deficiência, I realized the huge need to **structure data** and **standardize processes** to help in the management and analysis of information. This is crucial for improving the **quality of life** and **access to opportunities** for people with disabilities. **This project is my path to learn, teach, and contribute** to a bigger cause.

## 🔧 **System Objectives**

This project starts with the basics but will grow over time, just like the **association and the people it serves**. 🚀

**The system’s initial focus is**:

- 🧾 **Member registration** - Organize essential data of the association’s members
- 💰 **Dues control** - Record and manage the financial contributions of members
- 📊 **Financial management** - Create the foundation for controlling the association’s cash flow
- 📚 **Project management** - Organize the association’s actions and projects to increase its social impact
- ♿ **Inclusion and accessibility** - Ensure the system is accessible to everyone, without exceptions

This project is being developed with a focus on **learning and practicing**. I am starting from scratch, which means each step will be an **opportunity for growth**, to **teach and learn with the community**.
